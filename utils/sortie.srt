1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Leo dreamed of flying.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,160
Everyday, he made paper wings, convinced that one day they would take him beyond the clouds.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,759
Everyone mocked him.

4
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:10,859
You'll never fly, Leo.

5
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:13,599
Paper tears, and so do dreams.

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,339
But Leo believed.

7
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:19,900
One morning, he climbed to the top of a hill, spread his arms, and jumped.

8
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,339
For a moment, he truly flew.

9
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:24,000
Then the wings tore.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,600
And Leo fell.

11
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:31,600
His dream had destroyed him, but below, children gathered the pieces, ready to build even stronger wings.

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,600
Because sometimes, a broken dream can inspire thousands of others.
