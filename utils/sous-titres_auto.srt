1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
Leo dreamed of flying.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,000
Every day, he made paper wings, convinced that one day they would take him beyond the

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,400
clouds.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,919
Everyone mocked him.

5
00:00:08,919 --> 00:00:10,960
You'll never fly, Leo.

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,800
Paper tears, and so do dreams.

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,640
But Leo believed.

8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:20,120
One morning, he climbed to the top of a hill, spread his arms, and jumped.

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,559
For a moment, he truly flew.

10
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:24,240
Then the wings tore.

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,839
And Leo fell.

12
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:30,440
His dream had destroyed him, but below, children gathered the pieces, ready to build even stronger

13
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,920
wings.

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,039
Because sometimes, a broken dream can inspire thousands of others.
